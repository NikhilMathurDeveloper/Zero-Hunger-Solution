Composting is an effective way to dispose of waste from animals, and while the hot weather helps the compost to reach and maintain the necessary heat quicker, care must be taken to ensure the dry climate does not cause the moisture of the compost to dry out.

It is still important to monitor the nitrogen intake of the compost to keep an optimal temperature, but the heat allows for it to be monitored less closely than in colder climates. 

It is important to take measures to retain the internal moisture of the compost, as well as adding water to it regularly, to ensure that it stays moist enough for the composting process to continue smoothly.

Aeration is important to improve the airflow of the compost, however care should be taken when monitoring the moisture of the compost to ensure that the extra airflow does not cause it to dry out too quickly.

As well as being compostable, remains of animals farmed for protein can also sometimes be recycled as a food source for other animals, however care should be taken to ensure that the carcass is not infected with any diseases before it is used for this purpose.
