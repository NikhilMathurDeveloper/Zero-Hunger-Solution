Well the main goal is to obviously ensure that no grains are wasted. Well how do we ensure this? Check the product management section! 

During the process of milling refined grains the bran and germ layers are removed. This bran and germ layers can be used for animal feed, or disposed entirely. In order to produce animal feed, this can be sent to a factory where accordingly the animal produce is generated. 

Wheat bran can also be used for other requirements, for example for consumption. Once again storing this wheat bran is the same as any other grain, and is done through well sealed containers with little to none moisture. Again this requires a dry environment in order for this recycling technique to work. 

Wheat germ is also another by-product which can be used for consumption. Once again, storing wheat germ is the same as any other grain, and is through a well sealed container with little to no moisture. 

These are all suited for a dry environment as the storage and re-use of these by-products are supported by the initial dryness of the climate. 

In terms of disposal, there are many techniques which can be initiated. Some of these disposal techniques will be more useful than others especially within a specific climate hybrid. One of the more sustainable techniques is composting. Now composting is very much relevant to a wetter environment. However, this can also be done in a drier environment with certain practices. For example, when you set up your composting bin, it would be useful to line the sides of the compost container with cardboard. Why cardboard? Well it will help retain the moisture and the internal heat required for decomposition. 

There are recommended tips:
	•	Situate your compost under the shade
High temperatures disrupt the process of decomposition and the microbes required for the process.
	•	A few ventilation holes
This will help minimize the water loss which is caused during evaporation. 
	•	No disturbances 
Don't turn your composite in a consistent manner, as this could result in the compost drying out at earlier stages. This drying out will result in inadequate decomposition, which means that the recycling has not been adequate. 
	•	More air pockets
Increase the number of air pockets in the pile, this is to introduce more moisture.  Adding a specific amount of green and brown materials will initiate a better composite process.Now you would add more brown materials than green. Brown materials include leaves, nut’s, shells, straw, paper.  Green materials include grass, food waste, crushed egg shells. 
	•	Cover the pile
Seal the moisture within the pile, and insulate heat outside. When moisture is maintained within the pile, the turning process should be initiated. 


Vermicomposting in arid regions:


Vermicomosting is another area of the field. There are some tips to boost composting within dry environments. 
	•	Again shade 
Shade will help retain the moisture required for the composting process. Suggestions in terms of situating your composite bin sunken into the ground. 
	•	Layers
Bedding layer over the composting zone. The types of materials range, however, it is always useful to use carbon reach materials which are available in a dry environment. For example some carbon reach materials include dry leaves, grasses, dead plant clippings, hay, straw)
	•	Water
Water rich mineral waste should be disposed of at a steady pace. What is rich mineral waste, well some examples include the mineral water waste of veggies and fruits. This water waste can be supplied, and will help the composting process. Water waste could be stored in freezer containers. Yes, this may be expensive, however, it is certainly worth the investment due its benefit.
