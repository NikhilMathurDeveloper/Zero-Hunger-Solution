Excessive Wet Weather  
	•	Waterlogged Soil: Excessive rain leads to waterlogged soil, which negatively affects crop health. It hinders root growth and nutrient absorption, potentially resulting in stunted plant growth and reduced yields. 
	•	Fungal Diseases: Wet conditions promote the spread of fungal diseases, further harming crops.  
	◦	Rice Blast Fungus: Affects rice crops. 
	◦	Wheat Stem Rust: Damages wheat plants. 
	◦	Corn Smut: Impacts corn (maize) crops. 
	◦	Soybean Rust: Affects soybean plants. 
	◦	Potato Late Blight Disease: Caused by a water mold oomycete, affecting potato crops. 
	◦	 Post-Harvest Losses: Even after harvesting, crops face losses due to fungal diseases. Globally, growers lose between 10% and 23% of their crops annually, with an additional 10–20% lost post-harvest. 
	•	Planting and Harvesting Delays: Prolonged wet weather can delay planting and harvesting, affecting crop quality and yield.  
	◦	Fieldwork Disruption: Excessive wet weather disrupts fieldwork, affecting planting, cultivation, and harvesting schedules. 
	•	Mitigation Strategies: Proper drainage, disease management, and timely planting are essential to mitigate these potential impacts. 
	◦	Effective Drainage Systems: Properly designed drainage systems help prevent waterlogging. Installing subsurface drains, ditches, and tile drains can improve soil aeration and prevent root damage 
	◦	Fungicides: Regularly apply fungicides to protect crops from fungal diseases. Consult with agricultural experts to choose the right fungicides for specific crops. 
	◦	Crop Rotation: Rotate crops to break disease cycles. Avoid planting the same crop in the same field consecutively. 
Minimum Tillage: Reduce soil disturbance to maintain soil structure and prevent compaction. Excessive tillage can worsen waterlogging. 
 
 
Heat and Drought Stress Effects: 
	•	Crop Development: Both heat and drought stress accelerate plant development. Hot weather during stem elongation tends to shorten crops compared to normal. 
	•	Short Crops and Yield: A shorter crop doesn’t necessarily mean reduced yield. However, fields in vegetative stages during heat may have affected yield components, such as reduced tillering. 
	•	Spikelets per Spike: The number of spikelets per spike is determined during the 4-5 leaf stage. Heat during this phase reduces spikelet production. 
Wheat: 
	◦	Feekes 4: Known as the “greening up” phase, wheat plants begin erect growth. This stage closely follows tiller formation. 
	◦	 
	•	Dry Conditions: Dry conditions influence yield components, and small grains may lose tillers due to limited soil moisture. 
	•	Cool Weather and Grain Fill: Cool nighttime temperatures during the grain fill period increase grain yield by extending the duration of grain fill.
