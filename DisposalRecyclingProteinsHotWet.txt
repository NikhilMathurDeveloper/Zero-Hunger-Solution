Composting is an effective way to dispose of waste from animals, and while the hot weather helps the compost to reach and maintain the necessary heat quicker, care must be taken to avoid rain from oversaturing the compost with water.

It is still important to monitor the nitrogen intake of the compost to keep an optimal temperature, but the heat allows for it to be monitored less closely than in colder climates. 

Water levels need to be closely monitored to ensure the compost does not become overly damp, with shelter put in place to prevent excess rainfall from "drowning" the compost.

Aeration is important to improve the airflow of the compost, and this improved airflow can help to prevent the compost from becoming overly damp.

As well as being compostable, remains of animals farmed for protein can also sometimes be recycled as a food source for other animals, however care should be taken to ensure that the carcass is not infected with any diseases before it is used for this purpose.
