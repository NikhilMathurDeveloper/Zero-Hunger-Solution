Composting is an effective way to dispose of waste from animals, however it requires a certain temperature to actually break down materials, and excess water can cause it to become too wet to properly break down materials.

The affects of the cold on compost can be countered by increasing the nitrogen intake, as this will in turn increase the temperature of the compost, however this should still be closely monitored to ensure the compost maintains the necessary temperature

Water levels need to be closely monitored to ensure the compost does not become overly damp, with shelter put in place to prevent excess rainfall from "drowning" the compost.

Aeration is important to both help prevent the compost from becoming overly damp by increasing the airflow and allowing the compost to retain less water, and to help the compost retain heat, keeping it at that ideal temperature for composting.

As well as being compostable, remains of animals farmed for protein can also sometimes be recycled as a food source for other animals, however care should be taken to ensure that the carcass is not infected with any diseases before it is used for this purpose.
