Sugar climates – longer periods of sub zero temperatures can cause beets to freeze and lose all value in processing. Storage life of sugar beets is reduced and sucrose lost when exposed to fluctuating temperatures or temperatures of -1C or below. Optimum temperature range is 1.5Cand 5C.  
Colder weather conditions allow the beet piles to freeze. When frozen, a beet stops respiring allowing for longer storability, as long as the beets do not thaw. Using a process of split pile storage methods that removes sugar beets from the centre of the pile allows natural temperatures to freeze the piles.
