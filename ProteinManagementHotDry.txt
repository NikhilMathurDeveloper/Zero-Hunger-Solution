Proteins intended for consumption within 2 days should be stored in a clean refrigerator at a temperature of 4°C or below, otherwise they should be wrapped tightly in plastic, foil, or moisture-proof paper and stored frozen.

Live fish require a close eye to be kept on the temperature of their water, to ensure the heat does not warm the water to an extent that it harms them, the dry climate should not affect them negatively in any way, so long as it does not reach extreme levels such as drought.

A dry climate does not pose any issue to poultry, however, at temperatures of 24°C and higher, cooling procedures must be carried out to ensure the health of the birds, as well as the quality and production of their eggs.

Cattle do not sweat effectively, making them more susceptible to heat, they begin to suffer physiological stress trying to deal with the heat at temperatures of 26°C and higher, making it very important to start cooling procedures such as making extra water available to them as they have very little ability to cool themselvees. This is especially important in a hot dry climate as rain is one of the ways cattle cool themselves, making it even more important to implement proper cooling procedures.
