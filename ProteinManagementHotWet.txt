Proteins intended for consumption within 2 days should be stored in a clean refrigerator at a temperature of 4°C or below, otherwise they should be wrapped tightly in plastic, foil, or moisture-proof paper and stored frozen.

Live fish require a close eye to be kept on the temperature of their water, to ensure the heat does not warm the water to an extent that it harms them, the water must also be monitored to ensure it has enough of an oxygen supply, as rain water can dissolve oxygen, causing fish to surface for water.

Live poultry are not negatively impacted by rain due to having waterproof feathers, but shelter should still be available to them for the sake of their quality of life, at temperatures of 24°C and higher, cooling procedures must be carried out to ensure the health of the birds, as well as the quality and production of their eggs.

Cattle do not sweat effectively, making them more susceptible to heat, they begin to suffer physiological stress trying to deal with the heat at temperatures of 26°C and higher, making it very important to start cooling procedures such as making extra water available to them as they have very little ability to cool themselvees. This is especially important in a hot wet climate as while rain can help to cool cattle, high humidity further reduces their ability to cool themselves.
