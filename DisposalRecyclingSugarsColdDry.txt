Disposal - Rhizoctonia root and crown rot is one of the most severe soil-borne diseases of sugarbeet. Fields with high disease severity probably have resulted from a combination of wet conditions and a prevalence of other susceptible host crops in the rotation. Rhizoctonia root and crown rot may reduce yield significantly and diseased roots may cause problems in storage piles. Growers at some sugar cooperatives are required to destroy fields with more than a 50 percent incidence of root rot because infected roots cannot be placed in piles for-long term storage. 
Soil must be moist, but never wet or dry. 
Yield reductions are present after a drought, limited water availability limits leaf growth. Photosynthetic disruption and yield loss  is caused at an early stage of drought. 
Sugar beets would generally never be planted during warmer months, in hotter countries they should be planted during winter, as the optimal temp is between 1.5Cand 5C.  They can also tolerate sub zero spikes to -6C.
