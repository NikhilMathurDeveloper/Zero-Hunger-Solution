Disposal 
The NDEQ guidance for flood damaged grains and hay suggests that burning might be a preferable method for disposal of flood-damaged foodstuffs. Burning these materials may require careful monitoring over an extended period of time to ensure the fire is well-controlled and may produce significant smoke 
Remove flooded grain from bins and stack in a well-drained location away from farm facilities. If possible, separate wet and dry grain and store separately. Wet forages and hay that are no longer submerged in water can begin to generate heat within hours due to microbial activity. 
Composting may reduce the potential for livestock and wildlife to consume the contaminated grain and limit their exposure to potential toxins. It should also reduce the potential for germination of grain seeds following land application and the potential for volunteer corn in fields.
